# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

### A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value. A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is `created with the * operator`.

- File: `main.h` is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.

- File: `0-strcat.c` is a function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte.

- File: `1-strncat.c` is a function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
        --it will use at most n bytes from src; and
        --src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.

- File: `2-strncpy.c` is a function shouldthat works exactly like strncpy.

- File: `3-strcmp.c` is a function should work exactly like strcmp.

- File: `4-rev_array.c` is a function that reverses the content of an array of integers..

- File: `5-string_toupper.c` is a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

- File: `6-cap_string.c` is a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

- File: `7-leet.c` is a function that encodes a string into 1337.
